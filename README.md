Introduction:-

The IPLPrediXion project is a powerful tool that harnesses the power of machine learning to forecast the outcome of matches in the Indian Premier League (IPL) . With its rich dataset , this project aims to provide cricket enthusiasts, data analysts, and team strategists with valuable insights into team performance and factors influencing victory. 

Tech Stack:-

Scripting Language: Python

hosting partner: Streamlit

 Project Summary:-

The project consists of the following steps:
 Data Cleaning and Manipulation-
Before creating the prediction model, extensive data cleaning operations were performed to ensure the accuracy of the results. Rows containing null values were removed, and new columns were created by manipulating the existing data. This process helps to enhance the quality of the dataset and improve the model's performance.

 Model Creation-

A logistic regression model was built using the cleaned dataset. Logistic regression is a popular machine learning algorithm for classification tasks, making it ideal for predicting the victory of IPL teams. The model was trained on historical IPL data and can provide insights into team performance and factors influencing victory.

 User Interface-

To make the IPLPrediXion accessible and user-friendly,  Users can interact with the model through an intuitive interface that provides input options and displays the predicted outcome. The UI offers an enjoyable experience for users interested in exploring the performance of IPL teams and making predictions.

 Deployment with Streamlit-

The project was deployed using Streamlit, a powerful framework for building and sharing data applications.
